I want to create the design for a new product at Red Hat.
This new product will replace the existing OpenShift Serverless product.
OpenShift Serverless has 3 main components: Knative Serving, Knative Eventing, and Knative Functions.
Instead of using Serving, we will use KEDA for scaling.
We'll continue using Knative Eventing and Knative Functions.

This new product will be an on-premise version of AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions / Azure Functions.
It will allow users to deploy and run serverless functions on their own infrastructure.
The product will support multiple runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Go, and Java.
Users will be able to deploy functions using a CLI, a web console, or a REST API.
The product will also support event-driven architectures, allowing functions to be triggered by various events, such as HTTP requests, messages from a message queue, or changes to a database.
The product will include a built-in monitoring and logging system, allowing users to track the performance and health of their functions.
The product will also include a built-in security system, allowing users to control access to their functions and data.
The product will be designed to be highly available and scalable, allowing users to run their functions in a distributed environment.
The product will also include a built-in CI/CD system, allowing users to automate the deployment and management of their functions.
The product will be designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive user interface.
The product will also include comprehensive documentation and tutorials, helping users get started quickly.
The product will be open source, allowing users to contribute to its development and improvement.
The product will be licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing users to use, modify, and distribute it freely.
The product will be supported by Red Hat, providing users with access to professional support and services.

It will still run on OpenShift / Kubernetes as the underlying platform. However, not every persona will need to interact with OpenShift directly.
The main personas for this product will be:

---

1. **Serverless-Containers developer**

**Use-cases:** Enterprise App developers with large production workloads

This developer has workloads scaled up to a size where they need to consider concurrency, refined scaling, orchestration between Functions, and access to Container-level configurations (e.g. StatefulSet to enable persistence). This customer may be best served at the Container level, where Serverless 2.0 will handle Container provisioning & autoscaling and leave the rest to the developer.

---

2. **Function-Power-User developer**

**Use-cases:** Enterprise App developers, stock price adjustors

This developer has complex function use-cases that require deep integration into their enterprise infrastructure. They potentially need to create their own source/sink, handle Function performance limits (runtime limits), and follow proper CI/CD procedures. They prefer Functions CLI but will need Console for Functions monitoring/logs/troubleshooting.

---

3. **Function-Novice developer**

**Use-cases:** Data Scientists, Data processors

This developer expects to upload their function code, add a data source/sink (if needed), hit save-run and be done with Functions. They expect role/permissions, source-control, and other enterprise features to be automatically deployed as part of functions and configured by their OpenShift Admin. They prefer OpenShift Console over CLI.

---

4. **Vibe-Code developer**

**Use-cases:** Gen-Z, Gen-Alpha Devs

This developer expects OpenShift Serverless to create function code, source, and destination for them. The only input is their prompt on what App they want to create.


What would you recommend?
